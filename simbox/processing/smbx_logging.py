# Purpose built logger for diagnostics and recording during simbox experiments.
# Works with context managers. If not using context managers, call start()
# (right) before using and close() when done.
#
# We should also keep track of what files we're using and what for:
#
# main_hf.csv      | Used by:
#    "main": High-frequency data (100 Hz) generated by main.py
# 
# low_freq.txt     | Used by:
#    "main" (main.py): Diagnostics and status updates, etc. Some msgs also printed
#    "simulation" (sim.py): Warning about desync
#    "debug" (i2c_interface.py, serial_interface.py, debug_gpio.py): 
#            Status updates. Some also printed.
#    "arduino" (serial_interface.py): Infrequent status updates
#    "I2C" (serial_interface.py): I2C locking function only
#
# arduino.txt      | Used by:
#    "arduino" (serial_interface.py): Data sent to and received from arduino
#    "debug" (serial_interface.py): Data that would be sent to arduino
#
# i2c_debug.txt    | Used by:
#    "debug" (i2c_interface.py): Every write to the debug I2C (high freq)
#
# gpio_debug.txt   | Used by:
#    "debug" (debug_gpio.py): Reads from simulated GPIO pins.
